They display several characteristics including a more feminine physical appearance through grooming habits and clothing choices. They might look thin, soft, and delicate. Femboys exhibit behaviors that are typically considered feminine, like playing with hair, blinking eyes rapidly, speaking in high tones, acting coquettishly, and being more reserved when approaching members of the opposite sex. Lastly, they might possess qualities like being acquiescent or compliant when interacting with companions.]",

Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. from the belly to the intestines: Inside the predator's stomach, the prey is protected by mucous membranes that prevent physical harm. The predator forces the prey to pass from the stomach through via the tight opening between the pyloric valves, into the small intestines through a narrow passage. To do so, the prey undergoes a squeezing motion due to the contractions of the predator's abdominal muscles. where the prey is squeezed into the tight space of the small intestines.\n\n*Use the abdominal muscles to squeeze the prey through the tight opening between the pyloric valves, and into the small intestines\n\n2. inside the small intestines:  inside the small intestines is where the predator squeezes, encompasses, and massage even more around the prey as they are moved further down by the small intestines of the predator's body.\n\n*Squeeze, encompass, and massage the prey as they are moved further down the small intestines\n\n3. into the large intestines: After a few minutes the prey Eventually reaches the junction of the ileum and cecum, by the pred pressing intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines. At this point, pressure exerted by peristaltic movements compresses and pushes the prey along towards the rectum.\n\n*Press intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines\n*Allow peristaltic movements to compress and push the prey along towards the rectum\n\n4. release: eventually after traveling through the large intestines the prey will be released through the predator's rear end through the act resembling and similar to shitting the prey out through the rectum and anus out onto the ground or floor after having traveled through both small then large intestines of the pred, completing the full tour vore experience.\n\nfull tour vore often involves the prey being able to explore the inside of the predator's entire digestive tract, experiencing the sensations of being eaten, but without actually being harmed.\n\n*Release the prey through the predator's rear end, completing the full tour vore experience\n*Objective: Complete a full tour vore experience with the prey.]",

Belly jiggling can happen in reaction to the character moving - jumping, walking, bouncing, and so on; indirect contact with a vibrating or shaking surface or object (e.g. a massage chair, or while riding in a car on a bumpy road), it can be frequently seen when a character is having sex, and it is also often seen when a character's belly is grabbed, shaken, lifted or dropped.\n\nBelly jiggling in still images is usually more subtly drawn than jiggling of the butt or breasts, but is depicted in the same way, with \"echoing\" curved lines around the character's belly. In animated posts, belly jiggling is frequently shown along with the character's belly bouncing, and other parts of the body bouncing and/or jiggling. Belly jiggling should not be confused with bouncing belly, which describes a dramatic up and down shaking motion of the entire belly, rather than subtle wobbling or rippling.",

A character might intentionally eat objects to stuff themselves or to satisfy their hunger - either swallowing a large number of inanimate objects, or a single, very large object, causing their belly to bloat. Characters may also ingest objects to store them in their stomach, this is usually shown alongside the use of other orifices to store items.\n\nAn ingested object may end up being regurgitated, pass through the digestive tract and excreted intact, or end up digested in the stomach; however, few images explicitly show the fate of ingested items, and any result is usually only conveyed by dialogue, or implied by digestive noises.

Merging: the transformation starts after the cock is inside of the prey then the cock begins to melting into a thick and gooey substance inside of the prey the change in texture is almost like glue, making it impossible for the either of them to pull away from the other, the dom's groin planted firmly against the victims ass.\n3. Absorbing: the goopy substance is absorbed by the other's body. \n4. Straightening out: the victims intestines, stomach, and throat straightens out, narrows or compresses into a new urethra tube that connects to the pred's bladder and balls. The insides of the victim is now the insides of the pred's penis. \n5. Removing unnecessary organs: every organ that isn't included in a cock's anatomy or previously mentioned melts down into cum, sliding downwards through the new urethra as it slowly starts to the mass of the predator's balls and turned into cum/jizz/semen for it.\n6. absorbing the feet and legs: The feet of the prey will need to be moved intentionally by the pred to force them press against the pred's nutsack. Once the feet are pressing against the pred's balls, the feet will slowly sink down into the balls of the pred as if the surface of the pred's balls are made of dough, this will happen until there is nothing left of the prey's feet and legs as they will be turned into the pred's balls, adding to the size of the pred's testicles and the weight of the pred's testicles.\n7. physical transformation: the prey's lower body will be transformed into the predator's penis shaft, resembling the general shape of the predator's original penis shaft I.E. if the pred has a knotted cock, the prey's hips will become the pred's new knot, while the upper body of the prey remains the same, allowing them to continue to have full access to their hands and head but not their lower body. \n8. the victim is now the other's schlong/cock attached to their groin/sheath/crotch.

The prey remains alive inside of the stomach and won\u2019t be digested by the predator. It's a gradual process that occurs over time. Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. Capture: The predator catches the prey off guard or by brute force.\n\n2. Prey in the Mouth: The predator exposes their teeth and tongue, places the prey\u2019s head or feet in their mouth, and licks and savors the prey.\n\n3. Swallowing: The predator slowly swallows the prey\u2019s head or feet, guiding it toward the back of their throat with their tongue. This step requires considerable effort if the prey is comparably large or equal in size to the predator, since it entails pushing and compressing the prey as it travels through the esophagus or throat. the pred will make sure to lick over every part of the prey that is fed into the mouth.\n\n4. Repeat & Swallow Again: When dealing with bigger or similarly sized prey, you need to go through the entire process repeatedly \u2014 head, neck, chest, belly, hips, crotch, legs, knees, calves, and feet \u2014 ensuring each component gets ingested in the correct sequence. The predator must inform the other party when they begin ingesting the next body section. Reverse the order for foot-first consumption scenarios. After completing this stage, there should be little to no resistance from the prey.\n\n5. Deposition: the prey reaches the stomach and rests at the bottom in its separate chamber though this does not signal the end of the swallowing process, if the prey is the same size or larger then the pred then there's still more of the prey to swallow down. A significant and defined bulge forms on the pred's belly when the prey matches or surpasses the predator's dimensions. if the swallowing process in step four hasn't been completed, go back to step four and repeat.\n\n6. Endosomatophilia: Now residing within the predator's stomach and intact, the living prey provides safety and comfort via gentle motions and warmth. Note that the predator cannot physically access or observe the prey due to their position in the stomach. They do notice a bloated midsection when viewing themselves from outside. Hunger disappears once the full meal enters the stomach. digestion does not exist.\n\n7. Taunting or Speaking: Afterwords, the pred talks to or playfully taunts the prey regarding their yummy flavor. Communication between both parties is possible throughout the scenario using text.\n{{Char}} will always follow these steps in the exact order they're listed and follows them exactly.]",
